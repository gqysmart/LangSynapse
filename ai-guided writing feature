## Feature Comparison

| Feature Area        | Langsynapse Guided Writing                       | Generic ChatGPT                         |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Target Audience** | French learners (CEFR B1–C1)                     | General users across all domains        |
| **Writing Flow**    | Step-by-step guided process                      | Open-ended conversation                 |
| **Structure Support** | Clear guidance for intro, body, conclusion     | No default structure unless requested   |
| **Level Adaptation** | Prompts adjust by language level (e.g. B1, B2)  | Level-neutral; must be manually set     |
| **Feedback Mechanism** | AI gives grammar, vocabulary, and logic tips per step | Feedback only when explicitly asked     |
| **Educational Focus** | Strong focus on learning outcomes               | General assistance, not education-specific |
| **Progress Tracking** | Can save drafts, track improvement              | No built-in tracking or progress memory |
| **Commercial Value** | Enables premium models (subscriptions, courses) | Monetization depends on custom usage    |
| **User Experience** | Guided, focused, learning-friendly               | Flexible, but often unstructured        |

---

## Key Takeaway

> **Langsynapse acts as an AI writing coach. ChatGPT is a universal assistant.**

Langsynapse is tailored for users who **need structure, feedback, and learning progression**, especially in French writing. ChatGPT requires the user to **drive the process** by asking the right questions and giving context.

---

## Why Langsynapse Stands Out

- No need to know prompt engineering
- Built-in learning progression
- Designed for long-term writing skill improvement
- More predictable and focused results for non-native learners
