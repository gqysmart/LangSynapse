# 💡 LangSynapse — Project Overview

LangSynapse is a language learning assistant powered by AI, designed to help users improve their writing, vocabulary, and fluency through personalized feedback, corrections, and context-aware suggestions.
C’est une démarche élégante de vouloir recentrer ton projet sur son objectif original tout en gardant une certaine maturité émotionnelle.

## 🧠 Why "LangSynapse"?

The name combines:
- **Lang**: short for "language"
- **Synapse**: the connection point between neurons — symbolizing learning, memory, and AI thinking.

## 🧭 Project Goals

1. Help users practice writing (journals, essays, messages).
2. Provide intelligent corrections and suggestions with visual clarity.
3. Introduce gamified memory and feedback mechanisms.
4. Be suitable for both **casual learners** and **serious language students**.
